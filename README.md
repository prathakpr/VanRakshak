# VanRakshak
No use of any game engine, made with core C++ with OpenGL powered SFML Graphic library.
IDE used -> Microsoft Visual Studio

I created this game with the help of the book "Beginning C++ Game Programming." It helped me sharpen my coding skills and gain a better understanding of game development concepts. Additionally, I utilized open-source graphic libraries like OpenGL and SFML to enhance the game.

Vanrakshak game is a sasticopy or a remake of Timber game.
